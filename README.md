# IKABomberman

Bomberman-like game created as a submission for a programming test for the Gameplay Programmer position at IKA.

Time spent: About 16 hours

The controls are as follows:

Start Game - Spacebar

Player 1 Movement: WASD
Player 1 Plant Bomb: E
Player 1 Detonate Remote Bomb: Q

Player 2 Movement: OKL;
Player 2 Plant Bomb: P
Player 2 Detonate Remote Bomb: I

If I if I keep working on this project, I would move more of the the blueprint logic into C++. I ended up using blueprints a lot more than I intended, for rapid prototyping purposes.
But by the end the time had run out, if I had more time I could probably code base this project into C++ in one day.
I think I would also make a "pick up and drop" mechanic so that players wouldn't be trapped in a corner if they placed a bomb incorrectly, leading to their death.

To compile and run this project, you will need Visual Studio, with the C++ packages installed.

To get keyboard input to work with multiple player controllers, I used an example found here:
